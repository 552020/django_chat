# Differences Between Django Running in Production vs. Development

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/deployment/checklist/

In Django, the `DEBUG` setting controls whether the application runs in **development** or **production** mode. Setting `DEBUG=True` enables a number of features that help developers debug and build their application, while `DEBUG=False` configures Django to operate securely and efficiently in a production environment.

#### 1. **Error Reporting and Debug Pages**

- **Development (`DEBUG=True`)**:

  - Django provides **detailed error pages** with stack traces and debugging information, including variable values, tracebacks, and more.
  - This helps developers quickly identify and resolve issues during development.

- **Production (`DEBUG=False`)**:
  - Instead of showing detailed error information, Django shows a **generic error page** to the user. This is crucial for security, as revealing sensitive information in production can expose vulnerabilities.

#### 2. **Static File Serving**

- **Development (`DEBUG=True`)**:

  - Django serves static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) directly using `runserver` during development.
  - You don’t need to configure an external static file server like Nginx or Apache for local testing.

- **Production (`DEBUG=False`)**:
  - Django does **not serve static files**. Instead, static files should be collected using the `collectstatic` command and served by a web server like **Nginx** or **Apache**, or from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
  - This improves performance and allows the Django application to focus solely on dynamic content.

#### 3. **Template and File Caching**

- **Development (`DEBUG=True`)**:

  - Files and templates are **not cached**, meaning every time a file is modified, Django reloads it. This is helpful during development to immediately see changes without restarting the server.

- **Production (`DEBUG=False`)**:
  - Django **caches templates and files** to improve performance, reducing the load on the server. Once templates and files are loaded, they remain cached until the server is restarted or the cache is cleared.

#### 4. **Security**

- **Development (`DEBUG=True`)**:

  - Django is more lenient in development mode. Features like **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** protection and **SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT** are typically disabled.
  - Security isn’t a concern because the environment is only for development and local testing.

- **Production (`DEBUG=False`)**:
  - Django enables strict security features by default:
    - **ALLOWED_HOSTS**: Only requests from domains listed in `ALLOWED_HOSTS` are allowed. This prevents **host header attacks**.
    - **CSRF Protection**: Django enforces **CSRF tokens** to prevent cross-site request forgery.
    - **SSL Redirect**: If properly configured, Django will redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS for secure connections.

#### 5. **Performance**

- **Development (`DEBUG=True`)**:

  - Performance isn’t optimized. Features such as **SQL query logging** are enabled, which slows down the application but provides useful insights during development.

- **Production (`DEBUG=False`)**:
  - Django performs **SQL query optimization** and caching, ensuring the application runs efficiently under load. Performance is a priority in production mode.

#### 6. **Database Configuration**

- **Development (`DEBUG=True`)**:

  - Django uses a more relaxed database configuration in development mode. Migrations can be applied quickly, and constraints like database connections are more forgiving.

- **Production (`DEBUG=False`)**:
  - Production environments require careful database management, including **connection pooling**, **read-replicas**, and **transactional integrity**. Settings are typically tuned for performance, reliability, and security.

### Conclusion:

The key differences between Django running in development and production revolve around performance, security, error reporting, and file serving. By setting `DEBUG=True`, Django provides features useful for building and debugging. In production (`DEBUG=False`), Django enforces stricter security policies and optimizes performance.
