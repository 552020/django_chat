### Note on Redis Host Configuration:

The `CHANNEL_LAYERS` configuration defines how Django Channels will connect to the Redis instance. Depending on the environment, you may need to change the host value:

- **For Local Development without Docker**:
  If you are running **Redis locally on your machine** (without using Docker), use `127.0.0.1` (localhost) as the Redis host:

  ```python
  "hosts": [("127.0.0.1", 6379)]
  ```

  This will tell Django to connect to Redis running on your local machine, typically at port `6379`.

- **For Docker or Docker Compose Setup**:
  When running the **Django app and Redis within Docker containers** managed by Docker Compose, use the **service name** `redis` as the host:
  ```python
  "hosts": [("redis", 6379)]
  ```
  In this case, Docker Compose will resolve the hostname `redis` to the internal IP of the Redis container, allowing the Django app to connect to it.
